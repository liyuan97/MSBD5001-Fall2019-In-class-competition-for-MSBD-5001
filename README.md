# MSBD5001-Fall2019-In-class-competition-for-MSBD-5001
## This repository to record the In class competition for MSBD 5001 

All code in the `MSBD5001-Fall2019 In class competition for MSBD 5001.ipynb` file.
And the result submition is `sub_PassiveAggressiveRegressor.csv`.

I build a pipeline to try 10 Regressor model from sklearn and Xgboost, finally chioced the `PassiveAggressiveRegressor` model.
And luckily get the rank 2/86 on the public leadborad.

Actually this data is not very suitable for machine learning. Because we use the video games information to predict `how long time` a specfic person's time on it. It's too random and the correlation between X and y is too small I think.
What makes me get the rank 2 position is really depends on lucky!
